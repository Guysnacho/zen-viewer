## :dart: About ##

This is a full stack app built to pull my support tickets. Going into this I had no experience with node or express servers, the component libraries I ended up using, the Zendesk API, or CORS workarounds. I almost gave up because I jumped from Vue to Spring Boot (Java) back to Vue to the current Vue + Express + Node setup.

Glad I stuck to it

## :sparkles: Features ##

:heavy_check_mark: Includes a nodejs backend for sending requests to the Zendesk api\
:heavy_check_mark: Uses component libraries to build a nice looking site\
:heavy_check_mark: If you look close enough you'll see my blood, sweat, and tears :);
